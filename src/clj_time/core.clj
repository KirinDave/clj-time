(ns clj-time.core
  "The core namespace for date-time operations in the clj-time library.

   Create a DateTime instance with date-time, specifying the year, month, day,
   hour, minute, second, and millisecond:

     => (date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)
     #<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456Z>

   Less-significant fields can be omitted:

     => (date-time 1986 10 14)
     #<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000Z>

   Get the current time with (now) and the start of the Unix epoch with (epcoh).

   Once you have a date-time, use accessors like hour and sec to access the
   corresponding fields:

     => (hour (date-time 1986 10 14 22))
     22

   The date-time constructor always returns times in the UTC time zone. If you
   want a time with the specified fields in a different time zone, use
   from-time-zone:
   
     => (from-time-zone (date-time 1986 10 22) (time-zone-for-offset -2))
     #<DateTime 1986-10-22T00:00:00.000-02:00>
   
   If on the other hand you want a given absolute instant in time in a
   different time zone, use to-time-zone:
   
     => (to-time-zone (date-time 1986 10 22) (time-zone-for-offset -2))
     #<DateTime 1986-10-21T22:00:00.000-02:00>

   In addition to time-zone-for-offset, you can use the time-zone-for-id and
   default-time-zone functions and the utc Var to constgruct or get DateTimeZone
   instances.

   The functions after? and before? determine the relative position of two
   DateTime instances:

     => (after? (date-time 1986 10) (date-time 1986 9))
     true

   Often you will want to find a date some amount of time from a given date. For
   example, to find the time 1 month and 3 weeks from a given date-time:

     => (plus (date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))
     #<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>

   To represent the amount of time between two DateTime instances, use duration.
   The in-secs and in-minutes functions can then be used to describe this
   duration in the corresponding temporal units:

     => (in-minutes (duration (date-time 1986 10 2) (date-time 1986 10 14)))
     17280

   An Interval is used to represent the span of time between two DateTime
   instances. Construct one using interval, then query them using within?,
   overlaps?, and abuts?

     => (within? (interval (date-time 1986) (date-time 1990))
                 (date-time 1987))
     true

   Note that all functions in this namespace work with Joda objects or ints. If
   you need to print or parse date-times, see clj-time.format. If you need to
   ceorce date-times to or from other types, see clj-time.coerce."
